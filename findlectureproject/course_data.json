Not only does the art production postdating World War II raise the questions of what art is or can be, but it is also concerned with endless possible ways in which the audiences can experience art. Contemporary art employs a range of new materials and technologies, questions the validity of intentionality and authorship, and addresses previously excluded audiences. It invades non-art spaces, blurs the boundaries between text and image, document and performance, asks questions about institutional frames (the museum, gallery, and art journal), and generates new forms of criticism. Much of the canon of what counts as important is still in flux, especially for the last twenty years.

While the focus of the class will be on historical, social, and cultural distinctions in relation to the spatial representations on screen, we will also pay precise attention to formal and stylistic techniques as well as to the narrative and non-narrative organization of films we analyze."

While providing students with the basic knowledge on architectural typologies of housing, the course aims to handle the problem of housing as a practice of spatial planning and design in urban context. As an experimental workshop, the course searches for a constructive relationship between architecture and urban design by generating rich, diverse and coherent housing areas as alternative to the current discourse and practice of mass housing."

Food is not only a bare necessity, it is also the medium through which knowledge, tradition and even history are transmitted, known and shared by all. The concept of ?foodscapes? emerged in the 1990s within the context of studies of social and spatial inequalities in public health and food systems. Since then, it has incorporated the study of the entire chain of food from its production to consumption especially in the context of changing notions of landscape and space. This course intends to introduce the term 'foodscape' as a part of urban studies. The term and its connotations will be explored through various aspects of urban and rural life; it is not just a material space, but includes socio-political processes. The course aims to investigate how food shapes and is shaped by the spatial characteristics of urban and rural environments, considering the historical, cultural, and socio-economic factors that contribute to the diversity of food experiences in places. Different approaches, such as analytical, systematical, or phenomenological, will be explored to develop a holistic spatial approach to urban and rural foodscapes. Each week, examples from around the world will be presented around specific themes to enrich the understanding of general concepts.\nThroughout the course, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the spatial intricacies that define a city's culinary identity. The course encourages a critical examination of the role of food in shaping the urban experience whereby the students will critically analyze the spatial dimensions of urban foodscapes, gaining insights into the interconnectedness of feasting, market spaces, and broader spatial dynamics that shape the culinary landscapes of cities."

The course will then continue with a brief analysis of different theoretical discussions and sociological perspectives for understanding disasters? The course will continue explaining how disasters may enhance the previous social inequalities before and may lead to multidimensional, contextual and intersectional vulnerabilities during and after the disasters. The course will then focus on the difference between `disaster risk management` and `disaster risk reduction` approaches. While the first one is emphasizing the period after a disaster, the later refers to preventive strategies, referring to risk perception, awareness and preparedness. The role of NGOs will be also covered in the course. Especially there will be a discussion on whether we can talk of a  `recovery` or a major social change after a disaster. In the course, various major disasters experienced in the world will be presented. Among them disaster/climate change induced migration will be particularly emphasized."

Throughout the course, the most frequently used anlysis methods and the most controversial debates on class cultures will be introduced. The last four weeks aim to utilise the overviewed concepts and debates to understand class-cultural hierarchies in Turkey. By the end of the course, the students will comprehend the relationship between culture, class and consumption, as well as their various workings in the everday life of Turkey."

The idea is to compare the logic of the (Ottoman) Empire and the (Turkish) Republic in this respect. Comparison between these two logics will be conducted with a particular emphasis upon the question of legitimacy. The resemblances and the differences in the ways in which state–subject relations have been legitimized in the era of Empire and that of Republic will be studied. In studying the question of legitimacy, priority will be given to the examination of such domains as law, justice, and ideology in the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic."

Nation-building is a decisive part of modernity. As such it has a longer history in Europe than in other regions in the world. In the Middle East, for example, nation building is a process that mainly got under way during the last (20th) century. Many problems facing this part of the world today –like the current political and social instability and questioned territorial boundaries – are closely related to the process of nation-state formation. During the last couple of decades the development of radical Islam has overshadowed what is happening on the level of nations and national identity formation. The aim of this course is to study this aspect of recent Middle East developments and to do so in the light of rich theoretical literature on nations and nationalism that has appeared since the collaps of the Soviet Union."

Validity of arguments (logic), the nature of truth and knowledge (epistemology), the fundamental categories of being (ontology), the meaning of linguistic expressions (philosophy of language), scientific concepts and theories (philosophy of science), the distinction between morally good and bad (ethics), and, finally beauty in nature and value of artworks (aesthetics)."

It is controversial for the complexity of environment, conflict of interest in environment, and human centered ethical traditions, concepts and theories neglecting non-human environment. So while uncertainty and conflict of interest increase the demands on ethical principles, the basic assumptions of traditional ethics are difficult to extend to the non-human environment. Environmental ethics must also be a theoretical field of ethics to deal, for example, with the following problems. People have rights, but do other (higher) animals? Do plants even have interests? Can only individuals deserve to be subject for moral considerations or can group of individuals, such as species and ecosystem also? These and similar questions are treated by both anthropocentrists and ecocentrists."

It tries to explore the role that emotion plays in the acquisition of  beliefs and desires, the relation between them, and their transformation into actions and policies. It studies also emotions considered as a component of life and experience and investigate whether they may themselves be subject to rational assessment. For this purpose it goes to the historical roots of the problem of emotions, e.g. what role does it play in our life? What is an emotion? These questions are important in the philosophy of mind and ethics. Philosophers have not always despised the importance of emotions. Hume, for example, claimed that reason is and ought to be, the slave of passion. Nietzsche, on the other hand, insisted that emotion and reason are not really opposite but complementary to each other. In this course, the claims of important philosophers are discussed and moral, aesthetic political implications of their view of emotion are criticized."

How can we draw boundary line between philosophy and literature? How are literary works structured? With these questions the course addresses the philosophical question about the role of art in human life. The continuity of everyday life and the coherence of artistic literature are distinct though closely related. In ancient Greece, Literature was crucial for philosophy´ s own self definition. Subsequent philosophy of literature has been denoted to overcoming Plato´s condemnatory theory. The vast majorities of theories follow Plato in treating literature as a distinct domain, separate from and subordinate to philosophy. But since Romanticism, some have argued for the essential unity of these two enterprises. The course studies the relation between life, literature and philosophy within historical context as well as in contemporary culture."

After developing some skill in identifying ethical and moral arguments and disagreement on such issues, major ethical theories such as utilitarianism, Kantianism,    egoism, etc., will be applied to these moral problems. In order to fulfill this aim, several concrete and pressing moral problems will be chosen. The student will be encouraged to write and think clearly about these problems, weighing alternative solutions and criticising those which are weak and untenable. The main focus will be to give the student the skill necessary to identify a moral problem and to introduce her to critical thinking over moral issues."

It aims to encourage students to think critically about multidimensional impacts of modern technological developments on various aspects of everyday life; to explore how technologies shape human life, society and environment by analyzing a number of noteworthy essays written by philosophers and influential researchers in this field, such as Heidegger, Marcuse, Foucault, Ellul, Feenberg, and Floridi. It also aims to stimulate students to develop the ability to identify, analyze and critically examine moral issues, new ethical problems and challenges raised by developments in modern technologies, especially developments in communication and information technologies, and develop the capacity to argue for a chosen position in discussions. Further, legal implications of advances in communication and information technologies in Turkey will be studied briefly."

For the purposes of the course, social policy is defined as regulatory and direct forms of public intervention into the market distribution of resources with intent to affect societal welfare. The course aims to familiarize students with the underlying causes, dynamics, changing forms and political economic outcomes of social policy. It starts with an introduction to the substance, key concepts (i.e. social welfare, social wage, equality, equity, redistribution, welfare state, poverty) and policy issues (social security, social services, health, education) encompassed within the discipline of social policy. It then proceeds with an evaluation of the major theories and perspectives (i.e. political liberalism, economic liberalism, conservatism, social democracy, Marxism, social democracy, feminism, anti-racism) that have both framed and explained the historical contexts in which social issues and policies were developed. Following a concise overview of the archaic social policies in the 19th-century Europe, the course continues with an evaluation of the emergence of welfare capitalism, different kinds of welfare regimes instituted in advanced capitalist countries, as well as the causes underlying such differences. It then focuses on the recent transformations in the conceptions of social rights, and social policies in the global political economy, and evaluates the prospects for European Social Policy."

            "Political economy is a major perspective in understanding the media of modern capitalism, which extensively operate as \"cultural industries\". The structure and operational logic of these organizations exhibit both similarities with and differences from other industries. Their common features with other areas of commodity production signify the fact that cultural industries are increasingly integrated into the general industrial structure and they explicitly operate within the field of economics. However, it is also obvious that the commodities they produce are extensively divorced from the commodity form produced in classical sectors of manufacturing industries. In other words, the commodities produced by cultural industries appear as symbols, which can be evaluated as one of the primary means in organizing the images and discourses through which people signify their own or others´ life. Through introducing the main perspectives in the political economy of communication and conveying how political economies approached to particular problem areas within the field, the ultimate objective of this course is to present a critical analytical framework of understanding the relation between symbolic and economic dimensions of cultural commodity production within contemporary capitalism."

It represents a critical review of contemporary theoretical positions on popular culture, particularly the ones developed by the Frankfurt School, neo-Gramscian Marxism and Birmingham School, Bakhtin, de Certeau, and Bourdieu. A brief introduction to the theory of ideology, with which most students are likely to be unfamiliar, will be made as it constitutes the basic analytical premise of popular culture studies. Special attention will be paid to the interplay of ideology, culture and power, the transformations of the field of cultural practices, and the contestatory character of popular cultural forms. Among the themes to be explored are the elite/mass or high/popular culture binaryism, the dichotomies of resistance versus domination and opposition versus ideological incorporation, the so-called postmodern collapse of cultural hierarchies, the pragmatics of diversionary practices in everyday life, and the politics of cultural transgression. Within this context, various popular cultural forms, texts and narratives (e.g. popular music, sports, and folktales) will be referred to as well."

This can be summed up as the transformation of nationally organized capitalism towards a disorganized, global capitalism. In the new sociology of the late-modern societies it is argued that contemporary societies take new forms and undergo new experiences as they are exposed to global uncertainties and complexity arising from the decomposition of organized capitalism. This course is designed with the expectation that the students will have a comprehensive understanding of changing forms of modernity from its inception to its novel forms in contemporary times."

Methodological difference of this course is that, social sciences and humanities are not considered general abstract theories, but they are handled within the framework of the historical conditions from which they emerged. In this regard, general epistemology debate will be made on historical-economic ground. The place of public administration discipline will be analyzed historically in the context of administrative reality as a dependent variable of capitalist social reality (or formation).

The structure and operational logic of these organizations exhibit both similarities with and differences from other industries. Their common features with other areas of commodity production signify the fact that cultural industries are increasingly integrated into the general industrial structure and they explicitly operate within the field of economics. However, it is also obvious that the commodities they produce are extensively divorced from the commodity form produced in classical sectors of manufacturing industries. In other words, the commodities produced by cultural industries appear as symbols, which can be evaluated as one of the primary means in organizing the images and discourses through which people signify their own or others´ life. Through introducing the main perspectives in the political economy of communication and conveying how political economies approached to particular problem areas within the field, the ultimate objective of this course is to present a critical analytical framework of understanding the relation between symbolic and economic dimensions of cultural commodity production within contemporary capitalism."

Special attention will be paid to the interplay of ideology, culture and power, the transformations of the field of cultural practices, and the contestatory character of popular cultural forms. Among the themes to be explored are the elite/mass or high/popular culture binaryism, the dichotomies of resistance versus domination and opposition versus ideological incorporation, the so-called postmodern collapse of cultural hierarchies, the pragmatics of diversionary practices in everyday life, and the politics of cultural transgression.

For that purpose, the theoretical framework of managerial economic decision making will be presented through conducting samples of experiments/games in the classroom (e.g., winners curse, bias in assessing risks) in decision making (particularly decisions in marketing and finance). The students will experience situations that they have to make many decisions of  their own that will also give them the opportunity to evaluate their own decision making process through a series of classroom experiments."

The course is intended to give students background on the interaction between economics, economic history, politics, international history, and international relations. In this context, the theories and history of international economic relations will be discussed with an emphasis on the significant issues in the twentieth century. During the lectures and seminars, the emergence and evolution of the international economy since the mercantilist era will be analyzed in the context of inter-state relations. The emphasis will be on the impact of inter-state system and military and security issues on the international and national and the interaction between them. Accordingly, the political impact on the operation of the international and national markets and the opportunities provided and limitations imposed on the political, military security, and autonomy issues by the market will be analyzed. In this context, the analysis will also focus on the interaction and the relationship between state and market, power and production, growth, development, distribution of wealth, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) and the multinational corporations (MNCs)"

The aim of the course is to develop a detailed critical/analytical approach to the study of the one of the most important political and economic issues facing EC/EU since its foundation, namely the enlargement of the Union to include new members. The course hence aims to complement more general courses on European integration and EU. By drawing on the experience and lessons of previous enlargements, the course will provide a detailed knowledge on the current enlargement process to include the 10 Central and Eastern European countries as well as 3 Mediterranean states; Cyprus, Malta and Turkey. The course also aims to develop a comprehensive and comparative approach to the analysis of EU-Turkey relations by placing it in the broader context of an enlarging and deepening Europe. Indeed, the overall impact of enlargement-both in terms of challenges and possibilities- for the EU can be studied not only by focusing on the internal (policy) implications and external implications of enlargement but also by placing emphasis on the uneasy relationship between enlargement and deepening of the EU. What emerges are the current recurrent contending visions of European unity (federalist versus confederalist; Atlanticist versus Europeanist) ant the pros and cons of a more differentiated Europe that appears to be breaking forth in the Union."

In this framework, the actors and the structures of foreign policy; domestic and external sources of foreign policy; foreign policy decision and policy making, decisional bodies and processes (individuals/leadership, groups, organizational and bureaucratic politics) and the issue of rationality in foreign policy are discussed through case stories in the seminars. Furthermore the complex interactions between ideas, culture, media, public opinion, interest groups, etc, and foreign policy are analyzed. Special emphasis is given on ``change and foreign policy`` and the ``state transnational actors,`` ``theory and practice in foreign policy,`` and ``foreign policy implementation``."

This can be summed up as the transformation of nationally organized capitalism towards a disorganized, global capitalism.

All this will be considered in the framework of the -European Balance of Power- and the traditional -isolationist foreign policy- of the U.S. in the last century. The beginning of World War I and its implications on the world balance of power will be considered. The developments in Europe and U.S. since 1919 until today will be examined. World War I and the new political structure after 1918 will be considered from the point of global developments. World War II and the involvement of the U.S. in European affairs, the Cold War Sovietization of Eastern Europe and the emancipation of the Third World ocountries are also to be discussed. The relations among the industrial and non-industrial countries in political, economic and military fields will be explained with some comments on future prospects for global developments."

How should our society be organised and administered?  Can humans live together, and if so how?  Is politics moral activity?  What is the nature of humans?  These are just some of the fundamental questions the classical political thinkers attempt to address.  Their answers vary enormously.  However it is not just a case of establishing claims to truth to do with the political world, we need to be aware that the great political thinkers were equally concerned to justify their claims.  How do they claim to know (or think they know) they are right?  Students will be thus introduced to more involved and very important philosophical questions concerning the nature of enquiry itself.  What is the nature of political reality (ontology), and how do we know (epistemology)?  Our classical political thinkers to be studied on this course supply us with highly detailed and often brilliant accounts of both.  And, importantly, their ideas remain valid in terms of the ways we go about attempting to understand our own political world today."

All of these pressures have their origin one way or another in the process referred to (often ambiguously) as modernity.  Modernity can be marked off for our purposes as involving two essential revolutionary currents and upheavals.  Firstly, in terms of the means of production - we have witnessed the spread and rapid proliferation of the economic practice of capitalism and industrialisation.  This has led to the growth of class politics, well underway during the 19th century, and the politics of resistance, criticism, reform and revolution.  Second, much political theorising has surrounded the means of administration which has drawn in particular debates on the nation-state and its mechanisms and the nature and would-be expectations of liberal democracy.  We shall also consider the development of totalitarian alternatives to liberal democracy and the dangers associated with them."

We cover thinkers who offer accounts of how society can be best organised and administered.  This is often an urgent question since societies do exist and do have to be ordered and administered.  And yet we encounter inevitably deeper-lying questions also as to how society might be organised and administered, not only effectively and efficiently, but so arranged as to do justice to human beings - provide security and freedom, and so on.  This causes us to enquire in turn as to the nature of humans and their societies, which raises further questions, such as how it is humans are capable of living in society at all.  Are we selfish or altruistic?  Are our natures fixed or malleable?  Do humans make society or does society somehow make humans?  These are some of the fascinating themes to be covered.  We range from Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and the early contract theorists through to the rise of German reason in the 19th century, post-Enlightenment criticism, to more recent 20th century postmodernist arguments.  We shall identify some key topics and principles which seem to encapsulate the concerns of political and social speculation, together with the practical political and social problems of the age in question."

The course on the one hand aims to dwell on the political character of energy from numerous angles: energy production, trade and consumption.  On the other hand, the course aims to dwell on the regulatory requirements regarding energy.  To this end it aims to provide an understanding of issues such as national and transnational regulatory capacities and mechanism (supply, demand and climate change"

            "This course investigates the substance of essential energy policy issues and provides the necessary skills for their planning with focus on sustainability. Electricity market restructuring and climate change mitigation are addressed as todays two distinct energy and environmental policy challenges. Fundamentals of electricity markets are explored in the first part of the course. The market clearing mechanism for electricity trading in a competitive environment is elaborated elaborating the underlying microeconomic theory. Short- and long-run equilibrium conditions in the electricity market are studied. The grid and reliability issues are explored together with the implied formulations for modeling power flow and auctions. An interactive power market simulation game is included to complement the understanding of theoretical issues and diffusion prospects for sustainable energy systems. In the second part of the course, the basic concepts and different approaches used in energy and environmental policy modeling are explored ranging from technologically detailed bottom-up energy models to top-down policy models. Modeling energy flow and pollutant emissions, developing investment planning models to evaluate the diffusion prospects for renewable energy technologies, evaluating the impact of energy conservation and demand-side management on CO2 emissions, modeling the macroeconomy and representing energy-economy-environment interactions form the learning objectives of this part. The course includes an electricity market simulation game as well as various practical case studies applied using the GAMS software."

As the State`s role in economic policy has reduced considerably and when the importance of knowledge and skills for the global economy is widely acknowledged, many governments are prioritizing education as a key policy area. Terms such as ´lifelong learning´ are frequently heard in educational discourse, yet this discourse is often separated from debate, policy and practice related to the challenge of sustainability. This course aims to make good this deficiency. Though the core themes, the course will provide opportunities for students to reflect on the potential for environmental education (EE) and education for sustainability (EfS) to play their part in shaping future agendas and practice."

            "The importance of outdoor play is widely acknowledged by early childhood researchers.  However, studies, which are conducted to investigate teachers outdoor play practices, proposed educational implications in relation to in-service and pre-service training programs about outdoor education. They suggested that in-service and pre-service teacher training programs are needed about facilitation of childrens outdoor play by teachers. As those researchers indicated, in-service teacher training could be one way to form teachers beliefs and improve their outdoor play practices. However, when teachers are graduated from university and participated to the regular system, they have generally configured their beliefs in relation to teaching and learning. When it is considered that beliefs are resistant to change, the role of pre-service teacher training programs in constructing pre-service teachers beliefs becomes more crucial. In other words, pre-service teacher training programs might be more effective to construct pre-service teachers beliefs of outdoor education and to make them capable in terms of facilitating childrens outdoor play and learning. In this regard, several research that have been conducted to examine the role of pre-service teacher training programs in forming pre-service teachers beliefs constitute an evidence for this foresight. From this point of view, providing an outdoor education course for pre-service teachers would be golden opportunity to train qualified and capable students in the issue of outdoor education. In addition, in Turkey, curriculum for early childhood education suggested teachers to conduct learning activities in outdoor environment as much as possible. Based on this guide curriculum, teachers are expected to create their own plans. At that point, as the teachers will be decision makers of the curriculum and classroom it is important to make pre-service students to develop positive attitudes toward outdoor education. Due to aforementioned reasons, presenting a course for outdoor education is significant for pre-service early childhood teacher training program."

Through the study of world literature, students will be expected to recognize, understand, and appreciate the diversity of other cultures and societies and the intrinsic value of national literary traditions different from their own. Consequently, they will be required to demonstrate a more global and historical awareness of their place in the world. Students will be required to identify specific characteristics of the various literary modes common to each national literature and literary period, and, thus, recognize the sources, qualities, and achievements of different national literatures and different literary styles and techniques."

Major works by Dickens, Thackeray, Charlotte Bronte, Trollope, George Eliot, Gaskell, and others capitalized on the burgeoning of serial publication and circulating libraries; on unprecedented growth of consumer capitalism at home and imperial dominance abroad; on worshipful audiences ranging from distinguished literary critics, to eminent leaders of society and politics, to vast numbers of middle and lower class readers. The result was a novel of confident power and narrative scope. By focusing on this period, we are able to survey many of the major authors of Victorian fiction while attending closely to a specific set of historical developments, class relations, and gender issues. The aim of the course is to instruct the students about the characteristics of novel as a literary genre and to show the classroom techniques for teaching the realist novel and to introduce them to the Victorian novel by close study of major texts from this period."

By focusing on the major theoretical approaches that are useful in examining and re-considering the immanent regularities of the school as a dynamic organism, this course is organized around a couple of overlapping circles of analysis. One of the major circle will focus on the issues of ecology of education; examining the ways in which schools are embedded within social, historical, and cultural contexts, the recognition of pedagogical domain as a site of (re)producing the technologies of collaboration with the families and the communities in the circuits of reciprocity principle, and the role in producing or transforming the existing power relations in society. Another circle will offer critical engagement with intra-institutional centers , i.e. a complex set of authority patterns and governance structures, rituals, micro practices established around the students, administrators, and teachers, and foundations of morality. This course does not offer a continuous reflection on the contemporary issues of education, but inhabits instead back and forth encounters of micro and macro level of historically and culturally sedimented discourses of that root silently within these circles."

Students will investigate higher education organizations by critically reviewing theories of organizational behavior and governance. We will discuss the theoretical underpinnings of these organizations and apply them to real and hypothetical situations in order to develop an understanding of how authority and power are exercised in higher education. When viewing post-secondary education through an organizational analysis, a broader view is taken looking at the entire system internally and externally. The first half of the course will be more theory driven while in the second half more attention will be paid to activities that universities engage in. As this is doctoral level seminar course , it will focus on deep readings of texts, constructive critique, and presentations in a collegial and reciprocal learning environment. Students will be expected to attend class, be up to date with the issues facing higher education, and actively engage in course discussion."

Global Oceanographic Anoxic Events (OAE) in the geologic history will be examined by chemostratigraphy. The Chemostratigraphy course will also examine the problems on a global scale by microanalysis. Global events took place on stage boundaries will be highlighted by chemostratigraphic applications."

            "The major difference between closed-loop supply chains and traditional (forward) supply chains is for a forward supply chain, the customer is at the end of the processes, and for a closed-loop supply chain there is a value to be recovered from the end-user. There are many different types of closed-loop supply chains in practice: production, distribution, commercial returns, repair/replacement, end-of-use/life closed-loop supply chains. The basic drivers for companies to consider closing their supply chains are legislation, environmental consciousness, profit, and customer expectations. Many closed-loop supply chains have a number of characteristics making their design, planning and control requirements different from those of traditional supply chains. Network design and operation, inventory and production planning and disassembly scheduling and sequencing are the fundamental issues for closed-loop supply chain design and operation."

Each week there will be eight scheduled hours in the studio in that time students will be able to work in consultation with the instructor. In addition, the course is based on lectures, working in the classroom and critique of the works in progress. During the first few weeks, a number of contemporary art projects will be assigned to the students, and they will be critiqued by students when they are completed. The projects are designed to develop students practical and technical skills in fine arts by using diverse materials and different methods. While working on their initial projects, students will begin their majör structural project with the instructor`s assistance. While students are experiencing a variety of techniques in artistic practices and methods, they will gain general knowledge of the history of art and contemporary art. Finally, students will learn not only the creative fields of art and the global organization of contemporary art, but also they will develop their presentation skills. Please note that the course content is subject to change based on the needs of the class."

The church authorities, emulating the ban on music in Wudaism s liturgy the ban on music in Judaism s liturgical practices, strived, in vain, to ban or restrict music from their activities, or at least, to strictly define the acceptable types of music so that others could be kept out. Nevertheless, under strong pressure from the congregations a series of social changes were implemented to incorporate music within the Christian ideology. Starting from the l5th century, a new social structure where a more liberal Christian tradition, proper to Europe, tolerating and even supporting a wide variety of musical tastes, appeared. Music examples from Medieval and Renaissance Europe will be presented and analyzed from both musical and social viewpoints. Students are required to conduct research and make class presentations. Grading is based on class presentations and a term paper."

The student will be informed about the most common functional foods such as fermented meat and plant-based food products, pickles with their rich probiotic concentration, fiber-rich foods, and protein-rich foods such as protein drinks, meat, fish, poultry, milk, dairy, and egg products. The beneficial medicinal and nutritional value of the rich probiotic, vitamin, mineral, protein, and polyphenol contents in these foods will be analyzed. The medicinal improving effect of probiotics, fibers, Omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, antimicrobial protein compounds, anticancerogenic and antiviral bioactive compounds such as quercetin, kaempferol, indol 3 carbinol, resveratrol, leukopen, catechins, proanthocyanidins, amygdalin, capsaicin, lemonen, coumarins will all be introduced in the lesson. Finally, the proposed lesson targets to teach the medicinal effects of the Omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, their beneficial effects to treat cardiovascular diseases and disorders will be discussed. Some of the other important topics of the proposed lesson will be as follows; the body weight, muscle strength, and body length improving effects of foods rich in high protein quality, the anticancerogenic effects of bioflavonoids, the medicinal effects of the fiber-rich foods on gastro-digestive tract diseases and disorders, and the anticancerogenic and antidiabetic functions of probiotic-rich foods with their cholesterol and trigliserid lowering functions. As a result, the student will be able to create a healthy diet supporting his/her academic as well as the overall quality of mental and body performance."

A layered history of multiple trajectories of feminist practices alongside complex historical cases of gendered and sexualized spaces are given. The emphasis is on the modern era starting from the I 9th century covering both revisionist accounts of canonical examples and those exploring new territory.

As a graduate level seminar, this course offers a way in which the perspective of biopolitics and issues on population, body, womanhood can be operationalized in order to shed light on the repercussions of political and economic discursive practices on the everyday gendered expectations. Throughout the classes, particular attention-ts given to Michel Foucault`s literature and secondary literature, providing the students an introductory re-reading basic sources of biopolitics and relevant discussions. Additionally, the course will be taught by a combination of assigned texts and interactive discussions. Each week we will dwell on one or two texts and explore the concepts and related arguments."

Then, we will read essays and short passages by Arendt, Foucault, Habermas, Rawls and Mouffle with the aim of reaching certain generalizations and comparisons.

Throughout the course, we will survey various methods of data identification, collection and analysis which are used to interpret artifact distributions at various geographical frames from intra-site to regional scales. In doing so, we will pay particular attention to theories that inform the development and use of different interpretations."

While the archaelogical data opens a window into the past applications of power,politics and ethnicity, we archaelogists add yet another perspective to the study of ancient settlements with our own biases originating from the quiet power struggles and rejuvenated national identities of our times.

While the use of simulation has increased dramatically over the last few decades across many scientific disciplines, the approach remains limited in social sciences and humanities such as archaeology, mostly due to the technological barrier involving coding skills. This course will help student become familiar with coding approaches, using the user-friendly ABM software of NetLogo for building, executing and analysing simulations. No prior coding abilities or other technical skills are required, as we will start from the very basics in NetLogo programming. More important than the usage of particular tools, is the aim to create a diligent and creative mindset of model thinking.This requires deep reflection and developing habits of thought,going through phases of trial and error. The course will be aimed in the first place at the students of the M.Sc. in Settlement Archaeology and M.Sc.in Digital Archaeology, but will also be highly relevant for students from other departments, especially those from the humanities and social sciences who have less experience with model-based thinking."

The birth of journalism in an historical context and the relationship between the grand sociological theories and media theories will be studied. The relationship between media atmosphere (which consists of the level of democratic development, characteristics of state and government in a given country), nature of the media ownership and civil society, and the practice of journalism will be discussed. It will be argued that media are a constitutive element in the power structure of societies. Professional unions and existence of a professional ideology among journalists will be two major topics. Journalists' role in reproducing the dominant ideas and values will be discussed. The course also aims to develop a sociological model to understand the functioning of the media."

We will ponder the usefulness of notions of mimicry, hybridity, orientalism, resistance, and migrancy in understanding postcolonial subjectivity. the intersections of these categories with the broder conceptual categories of race, class, gender, sexuality, and notion will be a critical area of inquiry."

The course will proceed chronologically, discussing first the early transition in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Then it will turn to the challenges that the post-communist countries faced throughout the mid to late 1990s. Compared to other similar courses, this course will be less descriptive and more analytical. Throughout the semester, we will discuss questions such as: What was communism as a political and economic system? Why did the Soviet Union collapse? What is the connection between political and economic reforms? Is democracy necessary for a well-functioning economy? Can democracy survive when economic reforms fail? How are post-Soviet leaderships able to come to power and maintain power?"

            "This course starts with an assumption, Research Method in Applied Ethics is qualitative and is based upon rules perspective. The reason for this assumption is that in ethics, both descriptive and prescriptive (normative) methods are inadequate. The former reduces ideas to law like generalizations of behaviour, while the latter gives a fixed catalogue of recipe like collection of norms. As a third alternative, rules approach assumes that at the rule governed level of ethical conduct, rules provide form for the ethical behaviour, while reducing neither ideas nor action to secondary status. Any and every field of applied ethics may be considered as a field of consensus over some rules.  A code of ethics, in this sense carries properties unique to rules, and not to law-like generalizations. A code of ethics as a rule first of all, has normative power, i.e., it tells us how to correct our behavior once we deviate from it. A rule in this sense is a criterion of making a choice. Secondly, a rule must have generality. It must be simple enough to apply to a wide range of cases. Thirdly, a rule must have necessity, i.e., must invoke, in the parties involved, a sense of obligation. The subject s feeling of obligation or of   normative necessity plus his performative act of obedience to rules is nothing but the closure of the structure called a code of ethics. Collection of a particular group of such structures for a particular field (such as media, business, environment, etc.) will constitute a part of the grammar of applied ethics. The first part of this course examines the concept of rule and related concepts such as rule governed behavior, normative power, constitutive-regulative rules and answers to such questions as What are the analytic (a priori) and empirical aspects of a rule? What is the logical make up of a rule  What are the relationships between rules and performative actions etc."

The aim of this introductory course will be to pursue such reflection in conjunction with a reading and discussion of texts by major thinkers of the past (e.g., Aristotle, Plato, Kant, Mill, Nietzsche). The course will thus categorize, classify and summarize some of the major ethical theories such as subjectivism, objectivism, conventionalism, utilitarianism, the appeal to nature, the appeal to the golden rule, Kantianism, egoism, etc. The main focus will be to identify the criterion of rationality that these theories imply."

The course commences with a conceptual and theoretical analysis of the international presence and actorness of the EU. Next, it overviews the legal bases and the institutional framework of EC/EU’s external relations, including the foreign economic policy and outlines various attempts to further develop EU’s foreign and security policy, beginning with European Political Cooperation, culminating in the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the recent move into the Common European Security and Defense Policy. Against this theoretical and historical background, the course assesses the Union’s relations with its peripheries to the east, south, and with the rest of the world. Finally, by way of conclusion, the challenges facing the EU foreign and security policy and the  Union’s international role and identity are examined in the context of a wider Europe."

In so doing, the course will seek and rehearse answers to the question whether these distinct mechanisms are evolving into one common European regime of human rights. The second objective of the course is to assess and evaluate what is arguably the most effective human rights protection mechanism in the world, namely the individual complaints system set up under the European Convention on Human Rights.

There has recently been a revival of interest in the concept of citizenship due to a number of contradictory developments such as the disintegration of the Soviet Union, European integration, migration, the reassertion of nationalism and globalization. Moreover, citizenship has increasingly been challenged by the rise of new forms of identity and demands for political recognition. The aim of this course is to explore the theory and exercise of citizenship and identity within the European context. It will provide a historical analysis of the main issues concerning citizenship and identity in contemporary Europe and examine the special challenges they face in increasingly complex societies, and in the process European integration. The course will first introduce students to the origins of the concept of citizenship and identity.

Understanding the factors that influence acceptance of information technology is of interest both to researchers in a variety of fields as well as procurers of technology for organizations. In that, researchers have studied a range of issues related to IT Acceptance. At the highest level, `acceptance` has been regarded as the theoretical analysis of innovation diffusion. This approach is appropriate to start with basic of IT acceptance. However, rather than general technological innovations, precise analysis of information technology acceptance has become a central concern of disciplines. This course aims to focus directly on the determinants and importance of user acceptance, rather than the broad issues of social diffusion. A number of theoretical approaches shall be investigated throughout the semester for a complete understanding of the issues involved with IT acceptance. In that regard, in addition to independently examining these approaches, other fundamental issues including information technology management frameworks, information technology governance, control of information technology will also be covered in class particularly concentrating on the relationships between these fundamental issues and information technology acceptance."

Further, Plateaued functions which is generalization of bent functions were introduced firstly by Zheng and Zhang (1999)are a special type of Boolen functions. Further Carlet and Prouff (2003) studyied to design cryptographic functions. Plateaued functions have been actively studied and have attracted much attention due to their cryptographic, algebraic and combinatorial properties. Very recently, Mesnager (2014) have characterized bent functions and plateaued functions in terms of moments their Walsh transforms. In the light of these developments, the above research topics will be considered this course. Moreover, these work will be implemented in mathematical software package MAGMA."
