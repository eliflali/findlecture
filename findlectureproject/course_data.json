Not only does the art production postdating World War II raise the questions of what art is or can be, but it is also concerned with endless possible ways in which the audiences can experience art. Contemporary art employs a range of new materials and technologies, questions the validity of intentionality and authorship, and addresses previously excluded audiences. It invades non-art spaces, blurs the boundaries between text and image, document and performance, asks questions about institutional frames (the museum, gallery, and art journal), and generates new forms of criticism. Much of the canon of what counts as important is still in flux, especially for the last twenty years. And the stage is no longer centered only on the United States and Europe but is becoming increasingly global."

            "This course aims to familiarize students with the necessary tools to critically analyze and historically contextualize cinematic representations of space. With a global emphasis, we will consider the ways in which cinema defines, reconsiders, and reshapes the notions of place. We will explore various approaches to cinematic space by studying a wide array of themes, concepts, and theories while also considering what happens to viewers sense of space and place in different media environments. The topics of the course will include domesticity, borders and movement, screening space and spectatorship, cine-museology, national and transnational spaces, animated worldmaking, and digital realisms. While the focus of the class will be on historical, social, and cultural distinctions in relation to the spatial representations on screen, we will also pay precise attention to formal and stylistic techniques as well as to the narrative and non-narrative organization of films we analyze."

Food is not only a bare necessity, it is also the medium through which knowledge, tradition and even history are transmitted, known and shared by all. The concept of ?foodscapes? emerged in the 1990s within the context of studies of social and spatial inequalities in public health and food systems. Since then, it has incorporated the study of the entire chain of food from its production to consumption especially in the context of changing notions of landscape and space. This course intends to introduce the term 'foodscape' as a part of urban studies. The term and its connotations will be explored through various aspects of urban and rural life; it is not just a material space, but includes socio-political processes. The course aims to investigate how food shapes and is shaped by the spatial characteristics of urban and rural environments, considering the historical, cultural, and socio-economic factors that contribute to the diversity of food experiences in places. Different approaches, such as analytical, systematical, or phenomenological, will be explored to develop a holistic spatial approach to urban and rural foodscapes. Each week, examples from around the world will be presented around specific themes to enrich the understanding of general concepts.\nThroughout the course, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the spatial intricacies that define a city's culinary identity. The course encourages a critical examination of the role of food in shaping the urban experience whereby the students will critically analyze the spatial dimensions of urban foodscapes, gaining insights into the interconnectedness of feasting, market spaces, and broader spatial dynamics that shape the culinary landscapes of cities."

The course will then continue with a brief analysis of different theoretical discussions and sociological perspectives for understanding disasters? The course will continue explaining how disasters may enhance the previous social inequalities before and may lead to multidimensional, contextual and intersectional vulnerabilities during and after the disasters. The course will then focus on the difference between `disaster risk management` and `disaster risk reduction` approaches. While the first one is emphasizing the period after a disaster, the later refers to preventive strategies, referring to risk perception, awareness and preparedness. The role of NGOs will be also covered in the course. Especially there will be a discussion on whether we can talk of a  `recovery` or a major social change after a disaster. In the course, various major disasters experienced in the world will be presented. Among them disaster/climate change induced migration will be particularly emphasized."

Then, it interrogates how seemingly individual and random choices and experiences, such as our tastes, leisure time activities, friends and emotions are related to inequality. Throughout the course, the most frequently used anlysis methods and the most controversial debates on class cultures will be introduced. The last four weeks aim to utilise the overviewed concepts and debates to understand class-cultural hierarchies in Turkey. By the end of the course, the students will comprehend the relationship between culture, class and consumption, as well as their various workings in the everday life of Turkey."

In the Middle East, for example, nation building is a process that mainly got under way during the last (20th) century. Many problems facing this part of the world today –like the current political and social instability and questioned territorial boundaries – are closely related to the process of nation-state formation. During the last couple of decades the development of radical Islam has overshadowed what is happening on the level of nations and national identity formation. The aim of this course is to study this aspect of recent Middle East developments and to do so in the light of rich theoretical literature on nations and nationalism that has appeared since the collaps of the Soviet Union."

The course will focus on three interrelated issues. The first one is the state of current paradigms concerning Middle Eastern cities. The second is the nature of social and economic networks that enabled harmonious relations between various ethno-religious groups living in Ottoman cities. For this end, special attention will be given to social and economic life from a communal perspective. The third issue is the family networks that form the second tier in communal bonds. Published primary sources concerning Ottoman urban history will be extensively employed for a deeper understanding of the urban fabric. The main aim of the course will be an analysis of private and communal networks that could provide a basis for a critical re-evaluation of contemporary literature on Middle Eastern cities."

Validity of arguments (logic), the nature of truth and knowledge (epistemology), the fundamental categories of being (ontology), the meaning of linguistic expressions (philosophy of language), scientific concepts and theories (philosophy of science), the distinction between morally good and bad (ethics), and, finally beauty in nature and value of artworks (aesthetics)."

It is crucial for the guidance of individuals, corporations, and governments in determining the principles affecting their policies, lifestyles, and actions across the entire range of environmental issues. It is controversial for the complexity of environment, conflict of interest in environment, and human centered ethical traditions, concepts and theories neglecting non-human environment. So while uncertainty and conflict of interest increase the demands on ethical principles, the basic assumptions of traditional ethics are difficult to extend to the non-human environment. Environmental ethics must also be a theoretical field of ethics to deal, for example, with the following problems. People have rights, but do other (higher) animals? Do plants even have interests? Can only individuals deserve to be subject for moral considerations or can group of individuals, such as species and ecosystem also? These and similar questions are treated by both anthropocentrists and ecocentrists."

            "This course is an inquiry into the role of emotion in a rational life. As an introductory course, it requires no pre-knowledge of philosophy. It tries to explore the role that emotion plays in the acquisition of  beliefs and desires, the relation between them, and their transformation into actions and policies. It studies also emotions considered as a component of life and experience and investigate whether they may themselves be subject to rational assessment. For this purpose it goes to the historical roots of the problem of emotions, e.g. what role does it play in our life? What is an emotion? These questions are important in the philosophy of mind and ethics. Philosophers have not always despised the importance of emotions. Hume, for example, claimed that reason is and ought to be, the slave of passion. Nietzsche, on the other hand, insisted that emotion and reason are not really opposite but complementary to each other. In this course, the claims of important philosophers are discussed and moral, aesthetic political implications of their view of emotion are criticized."

            "This course is an introduction to the philosophy of literature. The fundamental question discussed in this course is how philosophy, ordinary life and literature are related. How can we draw boundary line between philosophy and literature? How are literary works structured? With these questions the course addresses the philosophical question about the role of art in human life. The continuity of everyday life and the coherence of artistic literature are distinct though closely related. In ancient Greece, Literature was crucial for philosophy´ s own self definition. Subsequent philosophy of literature has been denoted to overcoming Plato´s condemnatory theory. The vast majorities of theories follow Plato in treating literature as a distinct domain, separate from and subordinate to philosophy. But since Romanticism, some have argued for the essential unity of these two enterprises. The course studies the relation between life, literature and philosophy within historical context as well as in contemporary culture."

Philosophical practice is an attempt by philosophers to return philosophy to its ancient and practical roots. The course, therefore, is an inquiry into the role of philosophy in our daily life. For this purpose ideas of of great philosophers from Pythagoras to Postmodenism are discussed and moral, aesthetic and political implications of their views of philosophy and practice are studied and criticized."

After developing some skill in identifying ethical and moral arguments and disagreement on such issues, major ethical theories such as utilitarianism, Kantianism,    egoism, etc., will be applied to these moral problems. In order to fulfill this aim, several concrete and pressing moral problems will be chosen. The student will be encouraged to write and think clearly about these problems, weighing alternative solutions and criticising those which are weak and untenable. The main focus will be to give the student the skill necessary to identify a moral problem and to introduce her to critical thinking over moral issues."

Selections from the most important works of these philosopherswill be read. Epistemological, metaphysical, ontological, and ethical issues of the Continental Rationalism will be investigated with reference to these central theses. Relations between Continental Rationalism and British Empiricism will be brought into view."

Philosophy of language and philosophy of cognition are relevant to understanding the evolution of language and hence to understanding these cognitive changes. The course explores some of these connections."

In this course we will first of all study the various formulations of the categorical imperative in Kants Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals. But in order to be able to assess the status of Kants moral philosophy in the history of philosophy, we will also look at a number of influential figures who  in their different ways  can be seen to have gone beyond Kant in their understanding of the role, status and functioning of morality."

It aims to encourage students to think critically about multidimensional impacts of modern technological developments on various aspects of everyday life; to explore how technologies shape human life, society and environment by analyzing a number of noteworthy essays written by philosophers and influential researchers in this field, such as Heidegger, Marcuse, Foucault, Ellul, Feenberg, and Floridi. It also aims to stimulate students to develop the ability to identify, analyze and critically examine moral issues, new ethical problems and challenges raised by developments in modern technologies, especially developments in communication and information technologies, and develop the capacity to argue for a chosen position in discussions. Further, legal implications of advances in communication and information technologies in Turkey will be studied briefly."

The aim of the course is to be familiarized with the different phases of Foucaults philosophy, namely the archaeological phase of the 1960s, the genealogical phase of the 1970s, and the ethical phase of the 1980s. Accordingly, Foucaults understanding of Episteme (1960s), Power (1970s), and Technologies of the Self (1980s) will be analyzed in class meetings."

The course starts with a survey of the above-mentioned non-naturalistic theories and naturalism in philosophy and then continues with a critical defense of contemporary naturalistic theories of human nature based on advances in biology and cognitive sciences. In relation to the human nature problem several other issues are also examined, such as ethics, politics, gender, violence, education, arts."

For the purposes of the course, social policy is defined as regulatory and direct forms of public intervention into the market distribution of resources with intent to affect societal welfare. The course aims to familiarize students with the underlying causes, dynamics, changing forms and political economic outcomes of social policy. It starts with an introduction to the substance, key concepts (i.e. social welfare, social wage, equality, equity, redistribution, welfare state, poverty) and policy issues (social security, social services, health, education) encompassed within the discipline of social policy. It then proceeds with an evaluation of the major theories and perspectives (i.e. political liberalism, economic liberalism, conservatism, social democracy, Marxism, social democracy, feminism, anti-racism) that have both framed and explained the historical contexts in which social issues and policies were developed. Following a concise overview of the archaic social policies in the 19th-century Europe, the course continues with an evaluation of the emergence of welfare capitalism, different kinds of welfare regimes instituted in advanced capitalist countries, as well as the causes underlying such differences. It then focuses on the recent transformations in the conceptions of social rights, and social policies in the global political economy, and evaluates the prospects for European Social Policy."

The structure and operational logic of these organizations exhibit both similarities with and differences from other industries. Their common features with other areas of commodity production signify the fact that cultural industries are increasingly integrated into the general industrial structure and they explicitly operate within the field of economics. However, it is also obvious that the commodities they produce are extensively divorced from the commodity form produced in classical sectors of manufacturing industries. In other words, the commodities produced by cultural industries appear as symbols, which can be evaluated as one of the primary means in organizing the images and discourses through which people signify their own or others´ life. Through introducing the main perspectives in the political economy of communication and conveying how political economies approached to particular problem areas within the field, the ultimate objective of this course is to present a critical analytical framework of understanding the relation between symbolic and economic dimensions of cultural commodity production within contemporary capitalism."

A brief introduction to the theory of ideology, with which most students are likely to be unfamiliar, will be made as it constitutes the basic analytical premise of popular culture studies. Special attention will be paid to the interplay of ideology, culture and power, the transformations of the field of cultural practices, and the contestatory character of popular cultural forms. Among the themes to be explored are the elite/mass or high/popular culture binaryism, the dichotomies of resistance versus domination and opposition versus ideological incorporation, the so-called postmodern collapse of cultural hierarchies, the pragmatics of diversionary practices in everyday life, and the politics of cultural transgression. Within this context, various popular cultural forms, texts and narratives (e.g. popular music, sports, and folktales) will be referred to as well."

During these two centuries the political scene of Europe was transformed drastically. The 19th century witnessed the destruction of the ancien regime which was under continuous pressure from the emerging capitalism and the bourgeoisie class. The age of revolution was followed by the rise of nationalism, which created a new European state system. The evolving political events, finally led to the WWI, which caused the collapse of three empires in Europe and to the expansion of the European nation state system. In this course, our purpose is to analyze the new cultural forms expressing these changes and the major economic dynamics that influenced this period."

The structure and operational logic of these organizations exhibit both similarities with and differences from other industries. Their common features with other areas of commodity production signify the fact that cultural industries are increasingly integrated into the general industrial structure and they explicitly operate within the field of economics. However, it is also obvious that the commodities they produce are extensively divorced from the commodity form produced in classical sectors of manufacturing industries. In other words, the commodities produced by cultural industries appear as symbols, which can be evaluated as one of the primary means in organizing the images and discourses through which people signify their own or others´ life. Through introducing the main perspectives in the political economy of communication and conveying how political economies approached to particular problem areas within the field, the ultimate objective of this course is to present a critical analytical framework of understanding the relation between symbolic and economic dimensions of cultural commodity production within contemporary capitalism."

Special attention will be paid to the interplay of ideology, culture and power, the transformations of the field of cultural practices, and the contestatory character of popular cultural forms. Among the themes to be explored are the elite/mass or high/popular culture binaryism, the dichotomies of resistance versus domination and opposition versus ideological incorporation, the so-called postmodern collapse of cultural hierarchies, the pragmatics of diversionary practices in everyday life, and the politics of cultural transgression. Within this context, various popular cultural forms, texts and narratives (e.g. popular music, sports, and folktales) will be referred to as well."

This is derived from the realist assumption that there exists a clear demarcation line between the domestic and the international. Yet this assumption has been questioned by theoretical analysis as well as practical developments in recent years. This course aims at elaborating domestic sources of foreign policy making in the context of Turkish politics. It is based on the hypothesis that an `interactional` approach better serves to the understanding of both Turkish domestic politics and Turkish foreign policy. Thus the course will explain domestic sources of foreign policy issues, like democratization, human rights, the Kurdish question, the role of the military in Turkish politics etc."

The unilateral and multilateral interventions as well as ´assertive multilateral´ interventions are to be specifically discussed with particular reference to different schools of thoughts."

The aim of the course is to develop a detailed critical/analytical approach to the study of the one of the most important political and economic issues facing EC/EU since its foundation, namely the enlargement of the Union to include new members. The course hence aims to complement more general courses on European integration and EU. By drawing on the experience and lessons of previous enlargements, the course will provide a detailed knowledge on the current enlargement process to include the 10 Central and Eastern European countries as well as 3 Mediterranean states; Cyprus, Malta and Turkey. The course also aims to develop a comprehensive and comparative approach to the analysis of EU-Turkey relations by placing it in the broader context of an enlarging and deepening Europe. Indeed, the overall impact of enlargement-both in terms of challenges and possibilities- for the EU can be studied not only by focusing on the internal (policy) implications and external implications of enlargement but also by placing emphasis on the uneasy relationship between enlargement and deepening of the EU. What emerges are the current recurrent contending visions of European unity (federalist versus confederalist; Atlanticist versus Europeanist) ant the pros and cons of a more differentiated Europe that appears to be breaking forth in the Union."

As a theme ``human rights`` is usually associated with somewhat peripheral political cultures in which the civil society is typically weak and grievances abound due to partisan, patriarchal or discriminating uses of public authority. The present course focuses instead on democracies in western Europe that seem rarely suspect in this regard, stretching from the UK, France and Germany to Iceland and Norway, from Spain and Italy, to Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland."

How is Russia coping? How does the European system manage to keep Russia within its orbit? This is a legal course in international human rights law that centres on actual cases in the system involving Russia. What are the typical grievances in practice? How are those grievances possibly remedied? The course seeks to rehearse answers to those and other questions through a close scrutiny of the actual case files evaluated and ruled by the European Court of Human rights, the central monitoring organ of the European human rights system."

The objective of this course is to  give a broad introduction to ideas and issues related to the EU´s international role and identity in a globalizing world. The course commenses with a conceptual and theoretical analysis of the international presence and actorness of the EU. Next, it overviews the legal bases and the institutional framework of EC/EU´s external relations and outlines various attempts to further develop EU´s foreign and security policy, beginning with European Political Cooperation, culminating in the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the recent transition into Common European Security and Defense Policy. Against this theoretical and historical background, the course asseses the Union´s relations with its peripheries to the east, south, and with the rest of the world. Finally, by way of conclusion, the challanges facing the EU foreign and security policy and the future of these policies are examined in an enlarging and unifying Europe."

The course then examines a series of important policy initiatives shaping the map of European political economy such as market integration, the Social Dialogue and the European Employment Strategy.

The mediating dynamic of change between the conceptions of early an late modernity is described through changes in the political-economic organization of capitalism. This can be summed up as the transformation of nationally organized capitalism towards a disorganized, global capitalism. In the new sociology of the late-modern societies it is argued that contemporary societies take new forms and undergo new experiences as they are exposed to global uncertainties and complexity arising from the decomposition of organized capitalism. This course is designed with the expectation that the students will have a comprehensive understanding of changing forms of modernity from its inception to its novel forms in contemporary times."

How should our society be organised and administered?  Can humans live together, and if so how?  Is politics moral activity?  What is the nature of humans?  These are just some of the fundamental questions the classical political thinkers attempt to address.  Their answers vary enormously.  However it is not just a case of establishing claims to truth to do with the political world, we need to be aware that the great political thinkers were equally concerned to justify their claims.  How do they claim to know (or think they know) they are right?  Students will be thus introduced to more involved and very important philosophical questions concerning the nature of enquiry itself.  What is the nature of political reality (ontology), and how do we know (epistemology)?  Our classical political thinkers to be studied on this course supply us with highly detailed and often brilliant accounts of both.  And, importantly, their ideas remain valid in terms of the ways we go about attempting to understand our own political world today."

The 20th century was arguably the most tumultuous in history, punctuated by two great human cataclysms and almost continual warfare and ongoing struggles and pressures, largely inherited from the previous century.  All of these pressures have their origin one way or another in the process referred to (often ambiguously) as modernity.  Modernity can be marked off for our purposes as involving two essential revolutionary currents and upheavals.  Firstly, in terms of the means of production - we have witnessed the spread and rapid proliferation of the economic practice of capitalism and industrialisation.  This has led to the growth of class politics, well underway during the 19th century, and the politics of resistance, criticism, reform and revolution.  Second, much political theorising has surrounded the means of administration which has drawn in particular debates on the nation-state and its mechanisms and the nature and would-be expectations of liberal democracy.  We shall also consider the development of totalitarian alternatives to liberal democracy and the dangers associated with them."

And in the final part, we will focus on the neoliberal political relations behind the contemporary art scene and the politics of museum display."

The course is divided into three sections. First, various attempts to develop a European foreign policy are traced, beginning with the creation of EPC in 1970, culminating in the EU s CFSP as laid down in the Treaty on the EU. Secondly, alternative approaches for understanding the EU s foreign policy behavior are presented. Against this theoretical background, the Union s relations with the rest of Europe, with the developing countries and with the US are examined."

We cover thinkers who offer accounts of how society can be best organised and administered.  This is often an urgent question since societies do exist and do have to be ordered and administered.  And yet we encounter inevitably deeper-lying questions also as to how society might be organised and administered, not only effectively and efficiently, but so arranged as to do justice to human beings - provide security and freedom, and so on.  This causes us to enquire in turn as to the nature of humans and their societies, which raises further questions, such as how it is humans are capable of living in society at all.  Are we selfish or altruistic?  Are our natures fixed or malleable?  Do humans make society or does society somehow make humans?  These are some of the fascinating themes to be covered.  We range from Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and the early contract theorists through to the rise of German reason in the 19th century, post-Enlightenment criticism, to more recent 20th century postmodernist arguments.  We shall identify some key topics and principles which seem to encapsulate the concerns of political and social speculation, together with the practical political and social problems of the age in question."

Tasks including various functions and situations of speaking will be integrated with up-to-date and authentic materials to enable students to express themselves spontaneously, fluently, and in the appropriate manner in English. The task types include monologues and dialogues accompanied by pronunciation, intonation, stress, and grammar activities when required. The reading and listening skills will be utilized as a means for speaking outcomes, and the writing skill will mainly function as a self-reflection tool. The course will also offer a supportive learning environment to help students gain an understanding regarding the phonological and morphological impacts of Latin and Greek on the English language."
